### Welcome visitor! 👋

<!--

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-->
- 🔭 I’m currently working with Angular/TypeScript based projects leveraging NgRx for application state management, and RxJS to operate Observable-Streams in a powerful manner.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript from each and every angle. Interested in Apps either running in the Browser or used as a Desktop solution with the help of Node.js.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on "improvements" or "experiment" projects for modern JavaScript applications with or without the help of an existing framework. Specifically interested in working solutions for MicroFrontend architecture where teams and code are really split and isolated.
